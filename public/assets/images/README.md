# Images Folder

Place your static image files here. These files will be served from the `/assets/images/` path.

## Usage

To reference an image in this folder, use:
- `/assets/images/filename.png` (absolute path)
- `assets/images/filename.png` (relative path - will be automatically converted)

## Example

Place `history.png` in this folder and reference it as:
- `/assets/images/history.png`

Files in the `public` folder are copied to the build output root during the build process.
